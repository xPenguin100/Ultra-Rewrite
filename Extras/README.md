Now, you may be wondering why I have been "not" focused on Ultra in the past few months. Well, school was a thing, now summer is a thing. But, I am releasing ONE update this summer that will change the bot industry forever. Besides that, expect new bug fix updates, updates when new releases of NPM packages are released, and so on. 

Before I reveal my big move this Friday, I want to give you a hint. No, it is not a music bot as those exist and Rythm 2.0 is coming soon and music bots are already hard to develop. It is something that will change one area of bots forever. Moderation. I am revamping one of the most used moderation features ever. I am excited to reveal a new feature I have been working on that is SO big it will basically cover for all other updates this summer. Now, below this is your hint. Good luck decoding before Friday!

Updates:
I plan to update Ultra regularly throughout the 2022-23 school year. Not as much as you think however, as I plan to do a major update every other month. I don't want to fail school so Ultra will be a side project this year. And plus, I do have some ideas for major updates for Ultra that I would like to implement before 2024. Please note that (hint) is the only major-major update coming in 2022 as all other major updates are actually just like updates that release a few new big things and that is it.
