Discord.js is-was a good programming/development platform, however it is dying. With Discord dying as well, all languages that code bots die as well. Discord.py was an amazing platform for beginners, but died fast as it didn't get the updates it needed. I learned everything I know of JavaScript majorly from Discord.js. Every time I had an issue, I asked for help in .gg/djs. Asking for help was all I needed to build what I know in D.js. Discord.js helped me learn programming. As I made mistakes, I learned from those and gained more knowledge about the language and how to develop. So, I thank Discord.js for teaching me everything I know about JavaScript. Even though Discord and D.js are dying, they will remain in our hearts. Again, thank you to Discord.js for teaching me EVERYTHING I know about JavaScript. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be where I am. Enough with that, I am quitting D.js and bot programming after I make this last update on Ultra which to be honest, I haven't done a lot on. I plan to work hardcore on this a bit this week and much next week. But after the update, I am done. Discord.js is a bad language now. Used to be amazing, they turned it into sh*t. Just like Roblox, and Fortnite. Used to be amazing games, they f*cked them up. \n\n**TL;DR:** I am quitting D.js after Ultra's last update. Thank you to Discord.js for teaching me everything I know about programming. And well, this might not deserve an `@everyone` ping, but so be it\n@everyone")
